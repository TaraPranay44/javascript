// primitive data types :

let str = "tara"    //string
let num = 32   //number
let bool = true        //boolean
let nulVal = null      //null
let empty = undefined    //undefined
                         // symbol (unique)

// non-primitive

//object
console.log(typeof(null));  // its type of object
console.log(typeof(undefined));   //but its a type of undefined itslef, as undefined is not an object
